// to the panel whose text field has focus. This works the same in every
// browser, and the iframe never needs to hold focus: when focus leaves an
// iframe, browsers blur the field focused inside it, so a field could not stay
// focused while the host keeps focus.
//
// Focus can still end up in an iframe (an element the browser focuses on its
// own, before the panel took over the page's focus handling, or a page that
// calls focus() to take the keyboard). Whenever a panel iframe has focus, it is
// put back, so keys keep reaching the host. A page that is not trusted
// (sandboxed) must never keep it: then the iframe is blurred when there is
// nothing to give focus back to.
