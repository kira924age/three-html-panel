// A web page shown as an interactive panel in a three.js scene.
//
// The page is loaded into an iframe, which gives it its own document, URL and
// globals: an existing app (a SPA with its own router and CSS) can be placed in
// 3D without clashing with the host. The page loads the agent (agent/entry.ts),
// which captures it and replays input in it; the host only exchanges messages
// with the agent (panel-connection.ts) and never reads the page's document, so
// the page can be on another origin.
//
// With `sandbox: true`, the iframe is sandboxed without allow-same-origin: the
// page runs on an opaque origin and cannot reach the host's cookies, storage or
// document, nor take the keyboard. It is not trusted; everything it sends is
// checked. Without it, the page runs as an ordinary page of its origin (a page
// on the host's origin with the host's privileges): only show pages you trust,
// from URLs you choose, never from user input or synced room state.
