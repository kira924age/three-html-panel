// Turns the host's pointer, wheel and keyboard input, received by the agent,
// into DOM events in the panel page.
//
// The panel iframe never receives real input (the host keeps it at
// pointer-events: none and does not let it hold focus), so everything here is
// synthesized. Synthesized events are not trusted, which means the browser
// skips some of its usual default actions. Those that matter for typical pages
// are reimplemented:
//
// - hover/enter/leave bookkeeping, and the :hover/:active/:focus state, as
//   attributes on the page's elements (interaction-marks.ts)
// - pointer capture, which throws for a pointer the browser does not know
// - focus (see VirtualFocus), and placing the caret where a field was pressed;
//   selecting text by dragging, double click (word) and triple click (line)
// - click and dblclick, only when the pointer did not move in between
// - wheel scrolling, and text editing in <input>/<textarea> (editing.ts)
// - selecting the page's text by dragging, and editing contenteditable
//   elements (selection.ts, contenteditable.ts)
// - the list of a drop-down <select> (select-popup.ts), and choosing options
//   in a list box (list-box.ts)
// - scrolling by dragging a finger or a VR controller, as touch does (pan.ts)
// - scrollbars: dragging the thumb, paging by pressing (and holding) the
//   track (the scrollbars in the image are the agent's own, see scrollbars.ts)
//
// Events are constructed from the page's own window, so that they belong to
// the page's realm like events the browser would dispatch there.
